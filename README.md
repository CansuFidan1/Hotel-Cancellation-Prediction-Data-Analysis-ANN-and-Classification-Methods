This project is a hotel cancellation prediction model using classification methods and artificial neural networks. 
Extensive data preprocessing, visualization, and the implementation of advanced machine learning techniques to achieve accurate predictions are involved.
Dataset is trained for ANN under 9 Models with different neurons. Each model is trained using 200 epochs and difference patience levels. (no patience, 10,100)
*The dataset for this project was sourced from Kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahsan81/hotel-reservations-classification-dataset*

Here's the abstract from paper:
**Abstract** : Reservation cancellations significantly impact the hospitality industry's revenue flow, resource management, and guest experience. This study aims to predict hotel reservation cancellations, identify 
contributing factors, and develop strategies to mitigate financial losses. Various machine learning techniques, including TensorFlow, for predictive analysis is used. The research employs Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) 
and traditional classification methods like Random Forest, Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Logistic Regression to develop and compare predictive models. Random Forest emerged as 
the most accurate model, highlighting the critical features influencing cancellations, such as lead time and average price. The study's findings offer valuable insights for optimizing room allocation, enhancing operational 
efficiency, and improving customer satisfaction through data-driven decision-making.

**Further to do**  I wish to add & work on lively dashboards. Please contact if you want to share yout thoughts about the code.
